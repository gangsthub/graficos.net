Remember to hide anything you don't want to be published in the `.gitignore` first.\n\nOk, now that our site is published (check [mine](https://github.com/gangsthub/graficos.net) for instance), let's link it to Netlify, so we get to do the deploy job from there:\n\n![Image showing the Netlify interface. We want to show specially the position of the \"New Site from Git\"](/images/uploads/2018-09-01-16_20_20-sites-_-paul-melero.png)\n\nSee the **`\"`New Site from Git`\"` button**? From there, Netlify will make us browse our repositories from Github and we have to choose our Blog repository.\n\nThe default commands for getting a Nuxt site up and ready are:\n\n* **`npm run generate`** (for generating a static site, wich is the one we want).\n* Or` npm run build && npm start` for the _SPA_ mode. But not in this case.\n\nIt will also ask us to specify the folder from where we are serving. It's **`dist`** for our Nuxt sites.\n\nOk, now let's add the CMS capabilities: Enters [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/)."
