  "body": "_Git stash_ might be one of the most useful git commands in my opinion. We can understand [git stash](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-stash) as a drawer where we want to keep temporarily some work done in a file (or multiple files) to keep on working on it afterwards.\n\nThe common use is:\n\n```\n> git stash\n```\n\nTo store everything in the working directory (meaning \"everything tracked\", which is everything that is not committed but new files not tracked yet).\n\nAnd then, to recover it:\n\n```\n> git stash pop\n```\n\nYou have also `git stash apply`, which will safely recover the stashed files but  leaving the copy in the stash. I'd rather use `pop`, that deletes the copy from the stash, to keep it as tidy as possible.\n\nTo see what is in the stash, you can list its content with:\n\n```\n> git stash list\n```\n\nIt gives you a _zero-based indexed list_. Something like:\n\n```\nstash@{0}: On branch-blah-blah 8675765 something\nstash@{1}: On branch-blah-blah 8675123 something\n```\n\nWith `pop` and `apply` (the command we've just seen: \"`git stash pop` or `git stash apply`\") you can also get an specific \"stash\" from the list with `stash@{n}`, being `n` the item index in the list.\n\nBut let's take a look at that \"**something**\" I added (as an example, of course). That would be normally a commit message corresponding to the last commit message you have in you commit history. But I'd prefer to put something _more meaningful_, like a \"custom commit message\", but for the _stash_. Is like labelling the box (imaginary 📦) I'm putting things inside.\n\nFor that end, you'd do:\n\n```\n> git stash save 'These files are an improvement over...'\n```\n\n(Something that makes sense to you.)\n\nBut, as I said, that will add everything in the \"working directory\" (BTW, \"working directory\" means an specify thing in Git, I invite you to look that up if you don't know it 😉).\n\nAnd, here we come: what if I only want to add 1 file to the stash?\n\n## Git push, it is\n\nFrom the docs, [git push](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-stash#_options) has several options; for adding one file could be something like:\n\n```\n> git stash push -- nuxt.config.js\n```\n\nBeing \\`nuxt.config.js\\` the file I want to save, preceded with \\`--\\`.\n\nAnd for adding a message, the full command would be: 🥁🥁🥁\n\n```\n> git stash push -m 'some message' -- nuxt.config.js\n```\n\nThat's the command to stash one file with a message. 😉\n\nThanks for reading! Have a nice day!",
