  "body": "Actually, there are a lot of keywords and special [syntax](https://help.github.com/en/articles/understanding-the-search-syntax) you may use to filter on your GitHub issues and pull requests, but this one seemed to be highly useful for me at one point, and might be also for you. Also, if you are a maintainer of an OOS repository, you might want to filter all your issues or PRs out to see what is left.\n\nAnd here it is: (Notice the - sign, which [means \"exclusion\"](https://help.github.com/en/articles/understanding-the-search-syntax#exclude-certain-results))\n\n<pre class=\"language-markup\"><code>is:issue is:open -author:<YOUR_GITHUB_USER></code></pre>\n\nIt is also \"case insensitive\", which means `-author:josh` is the same as  `-author:Josh`.\n\nThis is the Documentation for the \"exclusion\" syntax:\n\n* https://help.github.com/en/articles/understanding-the-search-syntax#exclude-certain-results\n\nAnd this is one of the references for filtering issues and PRs:\n\n* https://help.github.com/en/articles/using-search-to-filter-issues-and-pull-requests\n\nThanks to [Tania](https://twitter.com/taniarascia/status/1143372344028815360?s=20) for bringing the topic up on Twitter.",
