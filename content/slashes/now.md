# Now

As of now, this is the current state of things.

- **Side projects**: are going well, I want to finish 2 of them by the end of the year. I will be sharing more about them soon.
- **Writing**: I'm writing about statistics in one of the side projects. I'm love learning new things.
- **Reading**: I wanted to learn something different, so I started reading about [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). It's a new language for me, and I'm enjoying it.
- **Work**: I'm just switched to a new team, and I'm excited about the new challenges. I am going full-remote now, and I'm loving it.
