This is Paul Melero's website. You may know me as [@paul_melero](https://twitter.com/paul_melero) or [gangsthub](https://github.com/gangsthub/). The first version of this site was made by me in [the early 2000's](http://web.archive.org/web/20020603194144/http://www.graficos.net:80/). Yes, I was and I am a proud self-taught geek. I've also studied Agriculture Engineering among other things. I'm a father of two, and I'm married to a wonderful person.

I'm a **Web Developer** and engineer with a passion for technology and the Web. I've been working in the tech industry for more than 10 years, and I've seen a lot of changes. I've worked with many technologies, but I'm currently focused on JavaScript, TypeScript, [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), and [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/).

In case you are interested, I have also prepared an online version of [my CV üìù](https://paulmelero.netlify.app/).

This site is made with [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/), a [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) framework, and it's hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Be sure you check [the source code](https://github.com/gangsthub/graficos.net), as it is open source.

I invite you to check my [blog](/blog) where I share my thoughts about technology, web development, and other things.
