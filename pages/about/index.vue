    I'm a creative person. Since I was little I knew that our imagination was one of our most valuable assets.
    That's why I've been drawing ‚úè my whole life
    (checkout the very first version of my personal website with 14 years old) and I ended up becoming a graffiti artist.
    And after that, I got interested in design , then web desing, then UI and finally programming.
    I also studied engineering (because my parents didn't want me to study arts).
    Programming felt like the natural intersection between this two words: creativity and problem solving.
    But I have always felt like I was meant to collaborate and return to the Internet what its creators purpose stand
    for. Like I said earlier in this thread, I was truly inspired by the fact that you connected with me, Ohad.
    I really wanted to show you that I had good ideas, to impress you, mainly:
    because I think you have the power to make a significant shift in the current state of the Internet.
    And I have the enthusiasm, energy, and the knowledge (or the desire of knowledge) for helping you.
    As you can see I am a motivation driven person: I value working with people I admire and I can learn from,
    I value the technical challenges of my work, I value having a voice and feeling like I'm being listened,
    and I also value the feeling that I'm returning a positive impact through my work.
