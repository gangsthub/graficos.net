        I'm a creative person. Since I was little I knew that our imagination was one of our most valuable assets.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's why I've been drawing ‚úè my whole life and I ended up becoming a graffiti artist.
      </p>
      <p>
        After that, I got interested in design, then web desing, then UI  and layout and finally programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also studied engineering (because my parents wouldn't allow me to study Arts).
      </p>
      <p>
        Programming felt like the natural intersection between this two words: creativity and problem solving.
      </p>
      <p>
        But I have always felt like I was meant to collaborate and return to the Internet what its creators purpose stand
        for. I value working with people I admire and I can learn from, I value the technical challenges of my work
        and I also value the feeling that I'm returning a positive impact through my work.
